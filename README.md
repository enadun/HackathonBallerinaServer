# Anonymous Chat Room Engine

The aim of the project is to build an anonymous chat engine leveraging the capabilities of the Ballerina programming language and displaying its capacities. The application is intended to be written in bulk using the Composer and will run as a service. We also plan to build a working mobile or web client and communicate via http with the server application. We plan to utilize a web socket based connection with the client. However, depending on the time availability, we might opt to a simpler http polling mechanism.
